            # Notes
            This is a version of Nudge created by GitHub Actions.
            Nudge.app has been signed and notarized. The package has been signed, notarized and stapled.

            By default Nudge looks for a `com.github.macadmins.Nudge.json` file located in `/Library/Preferences`. If you would like to use an alternative path, please read the [README](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge/blob/main/README.md) or the [WIKI](https://github.com/macadmins/nudge/wiki)

            ## About the LaunchAgent
            This is a basic launch agent that opens Nudge twice an hour, every 30 minutes.
            If you would like to reduce the amount of times Nudge launches per day, it is recommended to create your own LaunchAgent.
